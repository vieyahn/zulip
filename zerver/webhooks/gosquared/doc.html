<p>
    First, create a stream for GoSquared for where you would like to receive GoSquared notifications
    and subscribe all interested parties to the stream. The integration will automatically
    use the default stream <code>gosquared</code> if no stream is supplied, though you will
    still need to create the stream manually even though it's the default.
</p>

<p>
    Next, go to the Zulip settings page and create a bot named GoSquared. Go to the account settings page of
    your GoSquared account and under Project Settings > Services > Webhook > Add New.
    Add the below URL under the section 'Enter a URL to receive requests:' and name the integration, Zulip.
</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/gosquared?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=gosquared</code></p>

<p>
    Note: <code>api_key</code> must be reconfigured to be the API key of your Zulip bot.<br/>
    If you want to change the stream default that receives notifications, change <code>stream=</code> in the URL.
    <br/>
    To change the topic displayed by the bot, simply append <code>&amp;topic=name</code> to the end of the above
    URL.
    Where <code>name</code> is your topic.
</p>

<p>
    Under notifications of your GoSquared account page, press <code>Add New Notification</code> and select when and
    why you
    want to be notified through Zulip. After you're done, remember to check the box of the webhook corresponding to
    Zulip.

<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're all set</b><br/>
    Your messages should look like this:
