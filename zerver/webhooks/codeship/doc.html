    Zulip supports integration with Codeship and can notify you of
    your build statuses.
</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for Codeship notifications,
    and subscribe all interested parties to this stream. We
    recommend the name <code>codeship</code>.
</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/codeship?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=codeship</code></p>

<p>
    where <code>api_key</code> is the API key of your Zulip bot,
    and <code>stream</code> is the stream name you want the
    notifications sent to.
</p>

<p>
    Next, go to your project settings - notification settings
    page. The url should look like the following:
</p>
<p><code>https://codeship.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/configure_notifications</code></p>
<p>where <code>PROJECT_ID</code> is the id of your project in Codeship.</p>
<p>Scroll to the <code>Webhook</code> section and fill out the form as follows:</p>

<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> When a build is
    triggered, you'll get a notification like this:
</p>
