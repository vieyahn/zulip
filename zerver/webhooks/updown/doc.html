<p>
    See Updown reports in Zulip! This is great to be up to date with
    downtime in the services you monitor with Updown!
</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for updown
    notifications, and subscribe all interested parties to this
    stream. We recommend the name <code>updown</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Go to <a href="https://updown.io/settings/edit">your Updown
    settings page</a> and in <code>WEBHOOKS</code> section, enter
    the following as the URL:
</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/updown?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=updown</code></p>


<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/>
    Now you'll receive Updown notifications for your service in Zulip.
