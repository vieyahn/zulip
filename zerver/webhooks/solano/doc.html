<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for Solano Labs CI Build notifications, and
    subscribe all interested parties to this stream. The integration will use the default
    stream <code>solano labs</code> if no stream is supplied in the hook; you still need
    to create the stream even if you are using this default.
</p>

<p>
    Next, setup a bot that you would like to use with this integration. You will need its
    API key.
</p>

<p>
    Next, follow <a href="http://docs.solanolabs.com/Setup/webhooks/#build-notification-web-hooks-outgoing">
    these instructions</a> for Outgoing Web Hooks to configure a webhook for your Solano
    Labs Organization and choose the repositories that should trigger a webhook a notification.
</p>

<p>Enter a url of the following format into the URL field:</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/solano?api_key=abcdefgh&stream=solano_labs</code></p>

<p>Where <code>abcdefgh</code> should be replaced with the API key of the bot you
    created earlier.</p>

<p>Leave the <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> fields blank and click <b>Add Web Hook</b></p>
<p><b>Congratulations! You're Done!</b></p>

<p>Your messages will look like this:</p>
