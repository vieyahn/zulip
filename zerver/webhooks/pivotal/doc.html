<p>
  Zulip supports integration with Pivotal Tracker and can notify you of changes
to the stories in your Pivotal Tracker project.
</p>

<p>
  First, create the stream you'd like to use for Pivotal Tracker
notifications, and subscribe all interested parties to this stream. We
recommend the name <code>pivotal</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Next, in the Settings page for your project, choose the Integrations
tab. Scroll down to the <code>Activity Web Hook</code> section, and enter
the following url:
</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/pivotal?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=pivotal</code></p>

<p>
  where <code>api_key</code> is the API key of your Zulip bot,
and <code>stream</code> is the stream name you want the
notifications sent to.
</p>

<p>
  Choose version 5 of the API. Zulip supports both version 3 and version 5, but
version 5 contains more information that lets Zulip format more useful messages.
