**Emoji URL** fields.

    * In the **Emoji name** field, enter a phrase for your emoji. Only
      alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores are allowed,

    emoji's image. The link must start with **http://** or
    **https://**.

        Please note that the image will be scaled down to 25x25 pixels
        in users' messages.

click the blue **Add emoji** button to add your custom emoji to your
Zulip organization.

7. Upon clicking the **Add emoji** button, you will receive a notification
labeled **Custom emoji added!** in the **Add a new emoji** section, confirming
the success of the addition of your custom emoji to your organization.
