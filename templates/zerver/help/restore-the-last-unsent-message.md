# Restore the last unsent message

If you accidentally exit the compose box while you are composing a message,
you can restore your previous unsent message.

1. Open the compose box by composing a
[new message or reply](/help/reply-to-a-message).
2. Click the **Restore draft** link that appears between the A (<i
class="icon-vector-font"></i>) and eye (<i
class="icon-vector-eye-open"></i>) icons in the bottom left corner of the
compose box.
3. After clicking the **Restore draft** link, the compose box will be
transformed to include the contents of your previous unsent message.
