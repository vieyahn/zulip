# Alert words

Zulip allows you to define custom alert words and phrases. When they are used
in any stream you are subscribed to, it works similarly to being
[@-mentioned](/help/at-mention-a-team-member) by another user.

## Adding alert words

{!go-to-the.md!} [Custom alert words](/#settings/custom-alert-words)
{!settings.md!}

2. Type the word/phrase you wish to be notified for into the **New alert word**
text box. (e.g. "Downtime")

3. Click on the **Add alert word** button to save it.

Once these steps are completed, you should see something similar to:

![Alert settings](/static/images/help/settings-custom-alerts-sample.png)

If any alert words are mentioned, they will be highlighted within the message,
and you will be alerted in accordance with your [notification settings](/#settings/notifications).

!!! tip ""
    Alert words/phrases are matched case-insensitive, meaning you don't have to
    care about capitalization when defining them.

## Removing alert words

Alert words can be removed with ease in the settings menu, by clicking the trash
(<i class="icon-vector-trash"></i>) icon left of the alert word/phrase to be
deleted.
