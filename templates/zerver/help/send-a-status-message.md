# Send a status message

Sometimes you want to talk about yourself in third person.  Zulip
provides a nice way to do this by sending a message starting with
`/me`, e.g.:

```
/me is going skiing this weekend â›·
```

Zulip will display your message with the `/me` token replaced by your
name, like this:

![Status message](/static/images/help/status-message.png)

!!! tip ""
    Status messages are frequently written in third person, in order to make
    them look grammatically coherent.
