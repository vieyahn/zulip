# Enable or disable Press Enter to send

Zulip supports configuring whether the **Enter** key on your keyboard
sends a message that you are composing.

By default, with the **Press Enter to send** checkbox disabled:

* The **Enter** key simply adds a blank line to the message.  This is
great if you want to write multi-line messages that include blank
lines, which is much more common in Zulip than in other chat products.
* To send your message, you can either press the **Send** button in the
compose box or from the keyboard, use **Tab** and then **Enter**.

However, if you check the **Press Enter to send** checkbox in the
compose box, the behavior will instead be as follows:

* There is no **Send** button in the compose box; Zulip sends your
  message when you press **Enter** (or **Return**) on your keyboard.
* If necessary, you can enter blank lines into your message using
  **Ctrl+Enter**, **Alt+Enter**, and **Shift+Enter**.
