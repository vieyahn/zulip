# Change the date and time format

By default, messages in Zulip are displayed with a 12-hour timestamp. If you are
used to seeing the time displayed in a 24-hour format, you can change the Zulip
timestamp's format from a 12-hour format to a 24-hour format. You may want to do
this to avoid confusion between A.M. and P.M. hours.

You can easily change the date and time format your messages are displayed in by
following a few steps.

{!go-to-the.md!} [Display settings](/#settings/display-settings)
{!settings.md!}

2. Select the option labeled
    **Display time in 24-hour format (17:00 instead of 5:00 PM)**, then reload
    the page in order for the change to take effect.
