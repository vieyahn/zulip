"""
This bot uses the python library `unirest` which is not a
dependency of Zulip. To use this module, you will have to
install it in your local machine. In your terminal, enter
the following command:
    $ sudo pip install unirest --upgrade
Note:
    * You might have to use `pip3` if you are using python 3.
    * The install command would also download any dependency
      required by `unirest`.
